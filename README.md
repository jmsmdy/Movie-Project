# Movie-Project

Rough Outline:
 - Scrape data TheMovieDB and Wikipedia about actors and movies from 2004-2018
 - Place this data in a MySQL database hosted on AWS
 - Try to see if there is a relationship between the ethics of actors and the financial/critical sucesss of the movies they are in

Team Members:
 - Paul Kruger
 - James Moody
